One-time setup for configuring the environment:

1. Melodica is generic in terms of size of posits so one has to run 
./Gen_Posit_Numeric_Types --posit-width 8 --exp-width 5
which is available in ./src_bsv/lib/
This will make generate the types package Posit_Numeric_Types.bsv (in this
example for a 8,5 posit). This package contains type definitions for the
various Posit sub-fields based on Posit parameter

2. Melodica Uses SoftPosit to compare and check the answers
The Softposit library used is : https://gitlab.com/cerlane/SoftPosit.git
One has to build the library, please refer the site for the same.

3.The Testbench compares the result with SoftPosit via BDPI functionanlity 
of BSV so one has to correctly change the BDPI function depending on the
requirement- the BDPI functions mapped to functions are 
in ./src_c/softposit_wrappers.c 
Example : if one has to check Adder 16 bits input
import "BDPI" positAdd16  = function Bit#(PositWidth) checkoperation (Bit#(PositWidth) in1, Bit#(PositWidth) in2)	;
if one has to check Adder 8 bits input
import "BDPI" positAdd8  = function Bit#(PositWidth) checkoperation (Bit#(PositWidth) in1, Bit#(PositWidth) in2)	;

4. To check and compare FDP instructions with SoftPosits, the Testbench has 
BDPI fucntions that has the sizes manually added due to the size issue that 
occurs when communicating with ./src_c/softposit_wrappers.c.  

5. In the makefile if the RANDOM flag is set - that makes the input random
using LFSR RANDOM_PRINT flag - that makes the input random using LFSR and also
print the intermediate values got during simulation
